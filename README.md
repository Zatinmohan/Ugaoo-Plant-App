# Ugaoo-Plant-App

A simple fully working plant based e-commerce application built using flutter. This application is used for buy plants and product based on plants. 
This application uses: 
- Firebase Databse
- State Management using GetX
- API management 
- Firebase Auth
- Shared Preference (Get Storage)

**NOTE**
- This is just a demo application used for educational purpose
- It is just to show how e-commerce application can be built using flutter. This application is not used to buy actual product. 
- I have used [Ugaoo](https://www.ugaoo.com/) to get the data such as pictures and details regarding products. Please visit once and help them out.
